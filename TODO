# General todolist to track things that need to be added to make life easier for would be fitters.
# If you have any suggestions that are not in this list and don't have time to add them yourself please add them to this list or email "p.stowell@sheffield.ac.uk".
- Add licensing info to every page
- Grep for swear words etc
- Spline implementation
- Event manager
- More documentation
- More flexible input formats (e.g., vectors of strings for all parameters in card file)
- Make output format appropriate for input format (e.g., ability to throw errors according to covariance and parameters in an output file)
- Basic validation checks for us to ensure everything works before making a public release
- Long term need to think about more sophisticated validation, e.g. continuous validation tools.
- Extend CINT libraries to all samples
- Organise all the different data reading classes

CWRET ADDED:
- Validate setting constraints from previous fit (i.e. the covar option in card file; say I want to do a nuclear fit constrained by a previous nucleon fit.)
  Previously had problems with negative chi2 when this was used; I think the _FREE covariances in the output .root files were wrong?
- Document fluxes properly
