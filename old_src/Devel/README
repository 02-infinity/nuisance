# This folder is setup for anyone wanting to quickly add new samples into the build environment for the fitter.
# The Tutorial classes contained here show how samples can be produced for 1D and 2D measurements, 
# with the standard functions you would need to perform simple fits.
# Development classes should be committed here, and will be moved to appropriate Experimental source folders when they have been validated.
