The root file contains 6 directories with the differential cross-section results and the muon neutrino flux histogram for T2K Run I-IV.

Summary of cross-section analysis:
 - True signal is defined as true CC1pi+ (after FSI) in the true FV of the FGD2 water modules.
 - Reconstructed signal sample is selected by requiring 1 muon and 1 positive pion reconstructed in the FGD2 X layer (please see TN for detailed definition of signal sample and sidebands).
 - Phase-space restriction: (p_mu > 200 MeV) && (p_pi > 200 MeV) && (cos theta_mu > 0.3) && (cos theta_pi > 0.3) in both true and reconstructed variables.
 - Production 5F, Data Run II-IV.

The differential cross-section is given as a function of: 
 - pion kinematics (PosPionMom, PosPionCos);
 - muon kinematics (MuMom, MuCos);
 - muon-pion angle (MuPiCos);
 - reconstructed neutrino energy (*model dependent result*, as it has been unfolded to the NEUT prediction) using two formulae:
   -- EnuRec_Delta (energy reconstructed by looking at muon kinematics and assuming Delta resonance);
   -- EnuRec_MB  (energy reconstructed by looking at both muon and pion kinematics).

Each roofile contains: 
 - hResultStat, hResultSyst: histograms of extracted cross-section from Data Run II-IV with statistical or total uncertainties;
 - hTotalCovariance: covariance matrix for all systematic uncertainties (NB: the first bin in all histogram is the under/overflow bin);
 - All the other histograms are the fractional covariance matrices for each source (NB: the first bin in all histogram is the under/overflow bin).
